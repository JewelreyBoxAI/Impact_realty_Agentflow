Built with a modern, modular architecture, it is poised to disrupt the real estate SaaS market and serve as a blueprint for multi-agent systems in other verticals.

---

## What We Built
- **Full-stack SaaS platform** with a Python FastAPI backend and a Next.js 14 React frontend.
- **Multi-agent orchestration**: Modular agent system for recruitment, compliance, deal management, and intelligent assistance.
- **Plug-and-play integrations**: Google Email, Google Calendar, Zoho, Broker Sumo, and more (all easily swappable between mock and live modes).

- **Mock Mode**: Fully testable, demo-ready environment with all integrations spoofed for rapid prototyping and investor demos.

---

## Why We Built It This Way
- **Speed to Market**: Mock Mode enables rapid prototyping, investor demos, and user testing without waiting for all integrations to be live.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Strict architectural boundaries between backend (agent logic, orchestration, integrations) and frontend (UI, user flows) for maintainability and scalability.
- **Future-Proofing**: Modular integration pattern allows for easy swapping of tools (Google, Zoho, etc.) and rapid expansion to new verticals.
- **Best-in-Class UX**: Modern, enterprise-grade UI/UX to compete with top SaaS products and delight users.
- **AI-Native**: Designed from the ground up for multi-agent, LLM-powered workflows, not just as an add-on.

---

## Capabilities for the Real Estate Vertical
- **Automated Recruitment**: AI agents source, qualify, and engage candidates, reducing time-to-hire and improving agent quality.
- **Compliance Automation**: Agents handle document validation, deal compliance, and regulatory workflows, reducing risk and manual effort.
- **Deal Management**: End-to-end workflow automation for transactions, approvals, and client communications.
- **Integrated Communications**: Email, calendar, and CRM integrations for seamless agent and client engagement.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Dashboard with live metrics, pipeline tracking, and actionable insights.
- **Custom Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for building and visualizing agent workflows.
- **Scalable & Secure**: Enterprise-ready, with robust authentication, CORS, and modular deployment.
